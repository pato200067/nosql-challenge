In this challenge, we delved into how the UK Food Standard Agency evaluate various establishments across the United Kingdom , and offer them hygiene rating. I happened to be contarcted by the editor of Food 
magazine, Eat, Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics where to focus future articles.
Two Jupyter starter codes were provided to serve as a guide in the set up and anaylysis process.
The necessary libraries were imported, mongoclient instance was created. 
The appropriate command code was used to upload the file into mongoDB to interface with python through pymongo library.
